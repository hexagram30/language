Section: About pyWordGen
Description: PyWordGen started life as a simple random name generator PHP
    script on <a href="http://middleearth.net">MiddleEarth.net</a>,
    re-incarnated as a set of perl scripts, then as a custom product for
    Zope, and now lives its life as a stand-alone python class.
Content: The true origins of the name generator (now PyWordGen) were in
    cryptography, or rather, the history of cryptography. Several years ago, we
    were playing with letter frequency analysis in different languages and at
    different historical times. (It was very interesting to see these trends
    over time...) We were wondering if character frequencies could indicate
    source language in old encryption styles (one-to-one mappings).
    <p>
    The information we collected was inconclusive, but the perl scripts
    we wrote gave birth to another idea: a character name generator for
    games. Since then, we have used it not only to create names for people
    in games and on Web sites, but to assist in coming up with vocabulary
    while developing whole new languages.


Section: The Future
Content: We'd like to weave more linguistically oriented material into the
    code (we're open to suggestions). PyWordGen  has delusions of the
    linguistic sort: it wants to simulate phonological and morphological
    evolution. How far this goes is anyone's guess, but right now it works
    and is tons of fun to play with ;-) Honestly, though, this started as a
    game and is currently used in games -- there are no genuine aspirations
    of academic accomplishment or the heady vapours of linguistic science.
