* upload to PyPI
* fix horrible hard-coding of word list files.
* write a script that generates
  - alphabets
  - consonants
  - vowels
  - stats
 (and adds them to svn?)
 this will require interactivity on the part of the user (is this a vowel? is
 this a consonant?)
* get corpora files working with setuptools
* maybe improve all this with a CLI tool framework like cliff
* move bin scripts into a script module(s)
* rename wordgen lib dir to anamyeter
* add word lists:
  - Tolkien languages
  - PIE
  - Proto-Celtic
  - Gaulish
* add new corpora specifically for names
  - distinuish place names, and
  - people names
