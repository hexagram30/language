* upload to PyPI
* fix horrible hard-coding of word list files.
* write a script that generates
  - alphabets
  - consonants
  - vowels
  - stats
 (and adds them to svn?)
 this will require interactivity on the part of the user (is this a vowel? is
 this a consonant?)
* get corpora files working with setuptools
* maybe improve all this with a CLI tool framework like cliff
  - move bin scripts into a script module(s)
  - add a command that lists the available corpora
  - add subcommands for generating just a word, a person name, or a place name
  - add a command for generating a list of words (in series, on a line)
  - add a command for generating a bullet list of words
* add word lists:
  - Tolkien languages
  - PIE
  - Proto-Celtic
  - Gaulish
  - Latin
  - Proto-Norse
  - Proto-Germanic
* add new corpora specifically for names
  - distinuish place names, and
  - people names
* in the corpora, move all the language components into one folder for that
  language
* convert languages into a sub-package
  - move fictional into that subpackage
  - split up languages into family groups
* don't keep stats in source (e.g., the pickle files)
  - keep those in ~/.anamyeter
  - generate them if needed
* reorganize coporpra
  - move the corpus.py moduel out of corpora
  - make corpora/<lang> dirs, where <lang> is the ISO abbreviation
  - make corpora/<lang>/sources/names.txt
  - make corpora/<lang>/sources/places.txt
  - make corpora/<lang>/sources/words.txt
  - make corpora/<lang>/alphabet.txt
  - make corpora/<lang>/vowels.txt
  - make corpora/<lang>/consonants.txt
