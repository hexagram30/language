* change copora to 
  . languages at the top level, with their respective files beneath that
  . move/convert pertinent stuff in old to fictional
  . convert pertinent stuff in "tmp" to fictional
* remove old, tmp
* add code exmaple pages on sf.net site (maybe take stuff off of old trac for that)
* upload to PyPI
* fix links to svn, download, etc.
* fix horrible hard-coding of word list files.
* write a script that generates
 o alphabets
 o consonants
 o vowels
 o stats
 (and adds them to svn?)
 this will require interactivity on the part of the user (is this a vowel? is
 this a consonant?)
* get corpora files working with setup tools
